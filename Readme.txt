Hi,

I just started to learn coding eariler this year(2022) after needing to use python to clean some data, and lately I have being having an itch for coding since I didn't find a job that I mainly code or analyze data by coding.
Therefore, I will be posing my projects here to showcase for future employers/contractors.

I will start posting videos on youtube coding these projects and maybe doing little commentary on why I am writing what I am writing.
Also, I might explain other data visuliztion tools such as tableau or PowerBi when I get the chance for fun.

What can I say I am a Data nerd :)
